The database used for Wylx is MongoDB and the java interaction library is downloaded by gradle
By default the database used is a local host databse from https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass
To start the database download and run MongoDB Compass then using default setting start a local database
If a different MongoDB database is to be used all the would need to be changed is the "Connection String" in the Database Facade Class
